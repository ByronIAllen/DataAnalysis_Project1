Age-adjusted Rate = Crude rate (see above) standardized to the age distribution of a specific population, usually the U.S. 2000 standard population.

Mean = The measured or estimated mean (average or central value of a discrete set of numbers)—weighted to the population characteristics for an attribute or disease during a specific year.

Adjusted Mean = Mean (see above) standardized to the age distribution of a specific population, usually the U.S. 2000 standard population.
